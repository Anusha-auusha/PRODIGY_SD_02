Task 2 - Generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it

# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple Python program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and continues until the user guesses correctly. It then displays the number of attempts it took to guess the number.

## Project Overview

The "Guess the Number Game" is a fun and interactive console application designed to test the user's guessing skills. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user must guess the number based on feedback provided by the program. This project is an excellent example of using basic control flow, loops, and user input in Python.

## Features

- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Prompts the user to input their guess.
- Provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
- Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly.
- Displays the total number of attempts once the correct number is guessed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `guess_the_number.py` file to your local machine.

### Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `guess_the_number.py` file is located.
3. Run the program using the following command:

   ```sh
   python guess_the_number.py

## Results

The program effectively challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number. The feedback mechanism helps the user adjust their guesses, and the program accurately tracks and displays the number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly.

#### Output
Guess the Number Game
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 62
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 56
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 59
Congratulations! You've guessed the number 59 correctly in 5 attempts.

## Conclusion

The "Guess the Number Game" is a straightforward yet engaging application that demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, and user input in Python. It provides an enjoyable way for users to interact with the program and improve their guessing skills. This project can be extended with additional features, such as difficulty levels or a leaderboard, to enhance its functionality and appeal.
